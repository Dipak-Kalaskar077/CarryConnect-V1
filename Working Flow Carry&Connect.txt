🌟 Carry & Connect – Full Project Flow (Very Simple Explanation)

Imagine how a real user will use your app from start to end.
This is the official flow your whole project follows.

✅ 1. User joins the app

User creates an account → login

User becomes a member of the platform

Every user can work as:

A sender (sending a parcel)

A carrier (carrying the parcel)

Or both

✅ 2. Sender creates a delivery request

Sender fills a form:

From where → To where

Package size & weight

Delivery date & time

Delivery fee

Description & instructions

After clicking Create Delivery:

Delivery is saved with status: requested

No carrier is assigned yet

This delivery will now appear in:

Sender’s My Deliveries

Available Deliveries for everyone else to see

✅ 3. Another user (carrier) sees available deliveries

They open the page Available Deliveries

They see all delivery requests made by others

If interested, they click Accept Delivery

✅ 4. Carrier accepts the delivery

When a carrier accepts:

The app assigns them as the carrier

Delivery status becomes: accepted

Delivery disappears from the available list
(because someone already accepted it)

✅ 5. Carrier picks the parcel

When they go to take the parcel physically:

They click Mark as Picked

Status becomes: picked

✅ 6. Carrier delivers the parcel

After completing the delivery:

They click Mark as Delivered

Status becomes: delivered

✅ 7. Review each other

After delivery:

Sender can rate the carrier

Carrier can rate the sender

Only one review each

🔄 8. Optional: Sender can cancel

Sender can cancel ONLY IF:

Delivery is still requested

No carrier has accepted it yet

Status becomes: cancelled

🎯 THAT’S IT — COMPLETE APP FLOW

Very simple:

Sender creates delivery → (requested)
Carrier accepts → (accepted)
Carrier picks → (picked)
Carrier delivers → (delivered)
Both rate each other → (reviews)


OR

Sender cancels → (cancelled)
