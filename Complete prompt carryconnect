You are an expert senior full-stack TypeScript engineer. 
Build a complete production-ready MERN/TypeScript web application named **CarryConnect** similar to Porter/WeFast but peer-to-peer. 
The app connects Senders who want to send parcels with Carriers already traveling on the same route.

🧱 Tech stack:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI + React Query + Socket.IO client
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Socket.IO real-time chat + JWT auth + bcrypt passwords
- DB: PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM or Prisma preferred)
- Storage: Local uploads folder for chat file attachments
- Deployment Compatible: Replit

📦 Core models:
User:
- id, fullName, username, phoneNumber, passwordHash, role ("sender"|"carrier"|"both")
- rating (float), totalReviews(int), createdAt

Delivery:
- id, senderId, carrierId (nullable), pickupLocation, dropLocation, packageSize, packageWeight,
  description, specialInstructions, deliveryFee, preferredDeliveryDate, preferredDeliveryTime
- status: requested | accepted | picked | in-transit | delivered | cancelled
- pickupOtp, deliveryOtp (string 6 digits)
- cancellationReason, cancelledAt
- createdAt

Message:
- id, deliveryId, senderId, receiverId, message, attachmentPath, attachmentType, createdAt

DeliveryLocation:
- id, deliveryId, latitude, longitude, timestamp

Review:
- id, deliveryId, reviewerId, revieweeId, punctuality, communication, packageHandling, rating, comment, createdAt

🛠 Features to implement:
1) Authentication
- Register, login, logout
- JWT access token, refresh token
- Role selection sender/carrier/both

2) Delivery creation + listing + filtering
- Sender creates delivery requests
- Carriers view available deliveries to accept
- Listing card must show sender name & rating

3) Accept delivery
- Only carriers can accept
- Sender cannot accept own delivery
- Confirm modal before action

4) OTP system (internal, displayed onscreen)
- Generate 6-digit pickupOtp when carrier marks **Picked**
- Generate 6-digit deliveryOtp when carrier marks **In-Transit**
- Show both OTPs only to sender in DeliveryDetails page
- Carrier must enter correct OTP to mark Delivered

5) Delivery cancellation system
- Only sender can cancel before picked
- Only carrier can cancel before in-transit
- Requires cancellation reason
- Shows Cancelled status + reason + cancelledAt

6) Real-time chat with Socket.IO
- 1-to-1 chat between sender & carrier
- Text + image file attachments (jpg/png)
- Seen receipts + typing indicator
- Auto-scroll & load last 20 messages with pagination

7) Profile view
- Show name, username, phone, rating, total reviews
- View profile from delivery details

8) Live GPS tracking (mock until real integration)
- Carrier sends location every 5 sec
- Sender sees Live Location card with timestamp & coordinates

9) Delivery status timeline UI:
Requested → Accepted → Picked → In-Transit → Delivered/Cancelled

10) Call buttons
- Sender can call carrier
- Carrier can call sender (tel:+91xxxx)

🔔 Important UI rules:
- Use ShadCN modals for confirmations & cancellation
- Sender sees OTP card beautifully styled (pickup OTP + delivery OTP)
- Delivery cards show sender name, rating, locations, fee, date
- Chat header must show fullName + phone number below

🧠 Behavior rules:
- All status updates should return full hydrated delivery object
  including sender, carrier, pickupOtp, deliveryOtp
- After updating status, frontend must invalidate queries & update UI immediately

🎯 Goal:
Generate the complete codebase (frontend & backend) step by step.
Create correct folder structure, DB schema, API routes, socket events, React pages & components.

Start by:
1. Initializing a new full-stack project in Replit
2. Creating database schema & migrations
3. Building authentication
4. Building delivery CRUD
Then proceed sequentially implementing features above.

Stop after each section and ask: **Continue?** before generating the next chunk of code.
